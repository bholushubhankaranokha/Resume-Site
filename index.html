            <div style="text-align: left;">
             <details>
                <summary>Question 1: Tell me about yourself.</summary>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 137, 231);">My name is Bholu Shubhankar Anokha. I am currently pursuing B.Tech in AI & DS, with a diploma in Electrical Engineering. I have skills in programming languages like C, C++, Python, and web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have experience working on projects in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, such as a Weather Prediction system using Bi-Directional LSTM. I am passionate about problem-solving, learning new technologies, and applying AI/ML to real-world problems.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Question 2: What are your key technical skills?</summary>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 137, 231);">I have strong programming skills in C, C++, and Python. I am familiar with web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and frameworks for AI/ML projects. I also have knowledge of databases, data structures, and algorithms. On the AI side, I have experience with Machine Learning models, Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Question 3: Can you explain one of your projects?</summary>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 137, 231);">One of my projects is a Weather Prediction System using Bi-Directional LSTM. In this project, I collected historical weather data, preprocessed it, and trained an LSTM model to predict future weather conditions for different cities. This helped me understand sequence models, time-series forecasting, and deep learning frameworks.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Question 4: What challenges did you face in this project, and how did you overcome them?</summary>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 137, 231);">The biggest challenge was handling missing or inconsistent data in the weather dataset. I overcame this by using data cleaning techniques and normalization. I also experimented with hyperparameters to improve the model’s accuracy.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Question 5: Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</summary>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 137, 231);">In 5 years, I aim to become an expert in AI/ML, contributing to innovative projects in data science, deep learning, or AI-based solutions, while constantly improving my technical and problem-solving skills.</p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Question 6: Why should we hire you?</summary>
                <p style="color: rgb(6, 137, 231);">I bring a unique combination of programming skills, AI/ML knowledge, and hands-on project experience. I am motivated, quick to learn, and ready to contribute to your team’s success.</p>
